	<h1>Loading Spinner History</h1>

	
	<p>Before the loading spinner there was the loading bar. They were both a visual indication that whatever program in use was performing an action or busy. The loading bar was very common up until the late 1990s, it was a horizontal bar that would fill up towards 100% depends on the bytes loaded. Around 1997 the loading spinner, also known as a throbber, was introduced with Flash. The spinning circle was essentially the same thing as the linear bar but was cleverly designed so that there would be less frustration and risk of people closing their browser while programs were working. It also looks nice because it was able to be centered in the middle of a screen so that it would be more clear and present at all times. If you go far back in history, the spinning circle is very similar to “Ouroburos” or the mythical sign of a serpent eating its own tail. It represents self reflection during dark times and now the boredom experience while suffering and waiting in front of the computer for something to load. </p>
